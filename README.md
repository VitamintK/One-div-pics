# One-div-pics
This repo is concept art.  
The concept is displaying a photo as a single HTML div using CSS.

[VIEW THE DEMO](http://vitamintk.github.io/One-div-pics/)

CSS generated by a [python script](https://github.com/VitamintK/One-div-pics/blob/gh-pages/one_div_generator.py).  Inspired by Lynn Fisher.
There is literally no practical use for this as it stands. Trust me, I spent at least a minute trying to think of some obscure fantastical use-case where you'd need 4.6MB of CSS instead of 50KB of jpeg. If you can think of one, let me know.
