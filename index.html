		<p>The picture above is a single &lt;div&gt; element.  Each pixel is a box-shadow of 1px height and width.  CSS generated by a python script.  <a href = "https://github.com/VitamintK/One-div-pics">Github repo here.</a>  Inspired by <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/09/single-div-drawings-with-css/">Lynn Fisher</a>.</p><p>There is literally no practical use for this as it stands.  Trust me, I spent at least a minute trying to think of some obscure fantastical use-case where you'd need 4.6MB of CSS instead of 50KB of jpeg.  If you can think of one, let me know.</p><p><b style="font-size:20px">Warning:</b> Don't click that div in the Inspect Element pane, unless you have hoards of RAM.  It'll try to load all the styles and hang.  If you want a smaller example whose source you can inspect, look at this <a href="artour.html">smaller example</a> of my friend.</p>
